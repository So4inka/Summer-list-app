Show us a snippet of JSON returned by your Airtable (you can find it under the API documentation) so we know you can access it and get the info you need. This __must__ be properly formatted. An example is below:

```json

            "fields": {

                "setup": "Why did the tomato turn red?",
                "punchline": "Because it saw the salad dressing!"
            },
            "createdTime": "2020-11-30T16:03:09.000Z"
